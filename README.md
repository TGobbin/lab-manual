   :sparkles: Welcome to our Lab Manual! :sparkles: 
</p>

This page has been forked from the Faylab Lab Manual, with inspiration from the Farré Lab Manual.
This is intended to be used for **incoming, current, and outgoing** members of our lab group. If we missed anything, please let me (email@) or prof. XXXX (email@) know. You can also do a pull request and we will review the changes. 

We hope this has all the answers you need!


__Instructions on how to adapt the lab manual for your group (byFaylb)__ This [short tutorial](https://github.com/thefaylab/lab-manual/wiki/Quick-steps-to-making-a-copy-of-the-lab-manual-&-publishing-it) steps through how to make your own copy of the lab manual repository and set it up so that it automatically publishes the book to the web (and updates as you make changes).

The content for this book was developed by the Faylab as part of our group’s participation in the Openscapes Champions program.
