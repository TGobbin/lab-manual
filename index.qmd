This is the lab manual for the XXX Lab at the University YYYY.\

The focus of our work centers around developing interdisciplinary modeling approaches to extend the scope of applications for fisheries and ecosystem-based management. More about our group's research activity can be found on our [website](https://thefaylab.com).

This lab handbook is intended to provide an overview for lab members and others about how we do our work, and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and for important information about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact XXXXX (email address) or make a pull request.
